AUDIO PROCESSING REPOSITORY FOR AUDIO-VISUAL-PROCESSING COURSE OF 2022/2023
============================================================================

Focused on Speech Detection through diverse strategies:
-------------------------------------------------------
* How?    
    - Frequency Analysis
    - Power Analysis
    - Zero Cross Rate
    - Cepstrum 
    - Finite State System for Silence Detection
    - Computing diverse properties from input files
    - Comparation of results with Database of other year subjects

Programming Skills
----------------------
* Basically all with C

    - File System manmagement (open, seek, close ...)
    - Pointers 
    - Makefile
    - Bash
    - Git
    - Structs
    - "Oriented Programming" with C
    - Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, free)
    - Meson builds
    - Ninja
    - Audacity export files and previous analysis
    - docopt

    and more


**P1:: PROCESSING BY BLOCKS**
----

Basically an introduction to audio processing.
Given an audio file and taking into account the WAVE structure.

| Canonical WAVE FORMAT (each cell is 4 bytes) |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|  ChunkID  |  
|   ChunkSize  |
| Format | 
|SubchunkID |
| SubchunkSize |        
| AudioFormat |
| NumChannels | 
|SampleRate|
 ByteRate | 
 |BlockALign |
| BitsPerSample|
|SubChunk21D | 
|Subchunk2 Size| 
|DATA | 
|DATA |
|DATA | 
|.... |

Once obtaining the information. We decide the best size for our sample blocks. 
Once having these, we compute the 3 following audio/statistics caracterization:

**MEAN OF THE SIGNAL'S POWER**

$10 \log_{10} (1/N \sum_{n = 0}^{N-1} xÂ²[{n}] )$
